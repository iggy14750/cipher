# cipher
This is Isaac Goss' paper on the RSA Cipher for his Math 0413 class.

Welp, Jeff, I took your advice and I'm writing it in LaTeX! :) I apprecieate you looking at it.

If you don't know how to use git/github [try this](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).  And if you don't want to get into it, we could just use email.

Thanks again!
