    \section{Abstract}
        Secrecy is, I believe, a natural human tendancy.  One is really only able to be oneself under the guise of confidentiality, even when not explicit.%Could just start on the next sentence.
        It has been known that for most of the time in which humans used language, the medium through which one may communicate with any other one of similar knowledge, humans have also made attempts to hide such messages.
        Beginning with the war messages of Julius Ceasar, to e-commerce in the modern day, encryption has served to hide messages from prying eyes.
        In this paper, we describe the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) cipher, its motivation, mathematical basis, and some implementation details.
